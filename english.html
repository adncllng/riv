                            <h2>Côte-des-Neiges</h2>Then, a little french village where tanners and farmers would use the flow of its narrow stream. Now, a metropolitan borough where students, newcomers and families mingle together. Côte-des-Neiges is a bustling area where hundreds of education and health workers circulate everyday. It is a pivotal area where all religious backgrounds exist and where 110 different languages are spoken. Over time, Côte-des-Neiges has become a gushing river that carries thousands of lives, where many stories of migration have converged.
                            <h2>The Project</h2>To celebrate the city of Montreal’s 375th anniversary, two artists will mark the uniqueness of Côte-des-Neiges by creating Rivières, a theatrical project presented in the borough’s historic sites. Rivières is a series of documentary performances. It is a tribute in which citizens will come together to meet and listen to one another. Audience members will navigate through Côte-des-Neiges’ singular landmarks where stories and perspectives have come to unfold. Created by Sofia Blondin and Veronica Mockler and produced by the Centre communautaire de loisirs de la Côte-des-Neiges, this is a free show that will be presented at the end of the summer of 2017.<br>More information will come.
