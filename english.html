			  <h2>Côte-des-Neiges</h2>Then, a little french village where tanners and farmers would use the flow of its narrow stream. Now, a metropolitan borough where students, newcomers and families mingle together. Côte-des-Neiges is a bustling area where hundreds of education and health workers circulate everyday. It is a pivotal area where all religious backgrounds exist and where 110 different languages are spoken. Over time, Côte-des-Neiges has become a gushing river that carries thousands of lives, where many stories of migration have converged.
